# Testing

Preconditions before start of the unit tests is to install docker on your system. The prefered way for ubuntu is
descripted [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
After install you have to restart your system

If you get an exception by unit tests on ubuntu like this

```shell
[ers-lifecycle-0] tAndSystemPropertyClientProviderStrategy : ping failed with configuration Environment variables, system properties and defaults. Resolved dockerHost=unix:///var/run/docker.sock due to org.rnorth.ducttape.TimeoutException: Timeout waiting for result with exception

org.rnorth.ducttape.TimeoutException: Timeout waiting for result with exception

...

Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: native connect() failed : Permission denied
```

You can try this.
[official website description](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

if this did not help you have to grand permissions to the docker.sock with the following command (use this with
caution!!!)

```shell
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```
